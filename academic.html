    <h1>Academic Acheivement</h1>
   <p class="Aca-justify">I completed my education and important life lessons, enabling me to pursue my goals with confidence.
After completing my FSc in Skardu, I joined Karakoram International University as a Computer Science student. Thanks to the dedication of my teachers and the skills I acquired, I started developing my own website within just one month. Alhamdulillah, I succeeded in this project.
This achievement is not only a personal milestone but also a source of pride and inspiration for other students, proving that with hard work and quality guidance, any student can achieve remarkable results.</p>
early education in Stak Roundu, Gilgit-Baltistan, studying at one of the best schools in the region for 12 years. This strong foundation gave me quality education
