    <h1><b></b>From Challenges To Success </h1>
    <p>As a first-semester student, I faced many challenges and difficulties, like errors and technical problems. Since I had no guidance from anyone, it was even harder because I wanted to build my website on my own. Many times, I fet that maybe I wouldn’t be able to do it, but I never gave up. With patience and continuous effort, I was finally able to succeed. This journey taught me the value of self-belief, consistency, and learning from mistakes. Every small error became a lesson, and every challenge pushed me to improve myself. Completing this website gave me confidence and motivated me to continue growing as a developer.</p>
